                      Objectives change based on the project(s) I undertake. Generally the tasks revolve around the same principles: web functionality, optimization, revamping, and maintenance. Some Projects simply require content updates (new logo, layout changes, text editing, etc.) while others request a full revamping/redesigning of the current website. Once I have renewed or changed things I will optimize sites for faster loading and to increase functionality for better user interactivity.
